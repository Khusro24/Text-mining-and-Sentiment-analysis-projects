In this Project I have performed the sentiment analysis of the comments in a youtube video of the Viral Ad by CRED.    

Analysis includes follwoing:  
☛ scraping youtube comments using youtube data API  
☛ Filtering the comments with replies while scraping and storing them in a csv file  
☛ Performed text-preprocessing tasks using NLTK library  
☛ Removal of stop words, tokenization, removing hashtags and @mentions from the comments  
☛ Further cleaning text data by removing hyperlinks,punctuation, pics.  
☛ performed stemming and lemmatization.  
☛ Generated a word cloud  
☛ performed sentiment analysis(positive, negative, neutral) of the comments.  
☛ performed subjectivity analysis(facts / opinion) of the comments.  
☛ plotting the results.  

This code can be extended to analyze comments of any youtube video with the help of access to a functional youtube Data api key.
